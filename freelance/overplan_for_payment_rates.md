When working on a freelance project, overplan and make a chart or doc that will
explain operational costs and time estimates for certain changes.

    "Some people tend to panic when they hear a number larger than they
    anticipate, so 'building' a project plan from the very start with a client
    helps ensure there's no surprises for either side."

Thanks, Karhu, for the advice.
